2. Data Preparation

- Use a CSV file where each column after "Timestamp" is an employee.
- Each employee's name should be in the first data row.
- Include a row labeled "Development Areas" (case-insensitive) in the "Timestamp" column.
- Each employee's development area(s) go in their respective column in that row (e.g., "Communication, Leadership").
- Survey questions/answers should follow after the "Development Areas" row.

CSV Example:

| Timestamp          | Alice       | Bob         | Carol    |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
|                    | Alice Smith | Bob Brown   | Carol C. |
| ...                | ...         | ...         | ...      |
| Development Areas  | Leadership  | Teamwork    | Feedback |
| Q1: ...            | 6           | 5           | 6        |
| Q2: ...            | 5           | 6           | 6        |
| ...                | ...         | ...         | ...      |
